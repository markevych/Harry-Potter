				The central character in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his aunt, 
				uncle, and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, at the age of eleven, that he is a wizard, 
				though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles.
				The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy.
				His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools 
				that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School 
				of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. 
				As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, 
				including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, 
				anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies 
				ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.

				Each novel chronicles one year in Harry's life during the period from 1991 to 1998.
				The books also contain many flashbacks, 
				which are frequently experienced by Harry viewing the memories of other characters in a device called a Pensieve.
				The environment Rowling created is intimately connected to reality. 
				The British magical community of the Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture, 
				European folklore, classical mythology and alchemy, incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands, 
				magic plants, potions, spells, flying broomsticks, centaurs, and other magical creatures, the Deathly Hallows, 
				and the Philosopher's Stone, beside others invented by Rowling. While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternate universe 
				and the Lord of the Rings' Middle-earth a mythic past, the wizarding world of Harry Potter 
				exists in parallel within the real world and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life, 
				with the action mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts), the West Country, Devon, London and Surrey in southeast England.
				The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets,
				ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population.

			<h3>Early years</h3>
			<p>
				When the first novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (
				published in America and other countries as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) opens, 
				it is apparent that some significant event has taken place in the Wizarding World â€“ 
				an event so very remarkable, even Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. 
				he full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. 
				After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, 
				and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.
				Despite Harry's aunt and uncle's desperate prevention of Harry gleaning about his powers,
				their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, Rubeus Hagrid, who is also his first contact with the Wizarding World.
				Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts as well as some of Harry's history.
				Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort
				who subsequently attempted to kill him as well. Instead, the unexpected happened: 
				Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and Voldemort 
				disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse. 
				As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, 
				Harry has become a living legend in the Wizarding World. However, 
				at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore, t
				he orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives, 
				the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard 
				without meals and torturing him like he is their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to 
				attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, 
				a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years, 
				from age eleven to seventeen.
